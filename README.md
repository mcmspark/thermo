# thermo
A sensor network Thermostat based on RPI Zero, Slice of Radio and PiTFT

I ended up integrating this with AWS IoT bridge

Once I had it working, I wanted it to show up in Home Automation.  To do that I swiched to an etirely different approach.

I am now running homebridge with a plugin of my own making.  I will post that project soon.
